# BlackBox (Tet)

## Goal

System for controlling and monitoring Lantern-like devices to create more complex games.

### Functional requirements
1. Devices must be able to be controlled remotely
2. Devices must be able to report their state
3. Devices must be able to report events
4. It should be easy to add new devices to system
5. System should be able support running on both local network and internet
6. System should be able to piggyback on existing infrastructure
7. System should be able to create its own infrastructure
8. System will give the organizer live overview of the game
9. System will give the organizer ability to control the game from his device(phone, laptop, ...)


### Non-functional requirements
1. The latency of commands must be low
2. The system must be able to handle large number of devices


## Devices

### Device types

There are two main types of devices:
1. Game stations
    - Big static devices connected to the main infrastructure

2. Servers
    - Devices that control localized subset of game stations
    - They are connected to the main infrastructure and often create it

3. User tokens
    - Small portable devices that are carried by players
    - They don't connect to the main infrastructure directly
    - They connect to game stations and report their state to them

Primary supported devices:
- Game stations:
    + [x] Lucerna
    + [x] Maj√°k
    + [x] Artefakt
    + [x] BlackBox
    + [x] Semafor
    + [ ] BT-reproduktor

- User tokens:
    + [ ] Semi-semafor
    + [ ] RFID token
    + [ ] Phone

## Communication between game stations and main server

- Devices connect to broker running on central server with mqtts with double sided certificates.
- All messages are to be send with qos 2 with small session keepalive time

### Glossary:
- `device_id`
    + unique id of the device

- `command_topic`
    + device specific mqtt topic used for controlling the device
    + "devices/`<device_id>`/commands"

- `state_topic`
    + device specific mqtt topic used for reporting connection status of device, announcing capabilites and initial state, where applicable
    + "devices/`<device_id>`"

- `event_topic`
    + device specific mqtt topic used for reporting events that occured on the device
    + "devices/`<device_id>`/events"

### Connection

After connection each device:

1. subscribes to `command_topic`
2. sets last_will to disconnect message in `state_topic`
3. publishes its capabilities to `state_topic`

### Disconnect

If a device disconnects:

The main server may choose to send commands to achieve expected state of the device with retain flag to `command_topic`

### Capabilities

Capabilities are sent to `state_topic` as json object.
Capabilities include:
+ commands
+ events
+ state object definition

#### Commands

Commands are sent to `command_topic` as json object.
Commands must be stateless and idempotent.
Commands are in form of:
```json
{
    "command": "command_name",
    "args": {
        "arg1": "value1",
        "arg2": "value2"
    }
}
```

Sending multiple commands at once is also supported using json array:
```json
[
    {
        "command": "command_name",
        "args": {
            "arg1": "value1",
            "arg2": "value2"
        }
    },
    {
        "command": "command_name2",
        "args": {
            "arg1": "value1",
            "arg2": "value2"
        }
    }
]
```

#### Events

Events are sent to `event_topic` as json object.
Events are in form of:
```json
{
    "event": "event_name",
    "args": {
        "arg1": "value1",
        "arg2": "value2"
    }
}
```

### Extensions

#### Configuration

- `configuration_topic`
    + device specific mqtt topic used for sending configuration to the device
    + "devices/`<device_id>`/config"

There might be a need to set persistent configuration on the device.
Specifically for devices that are expected to be offline for long periods of time.

Configuration is sent to `configuration_topic` as json object.
Following configuration options are to be supported:
- Adding/modifying context variables
- Registering handlers for events

Configuration commands have the same as normal commands.

##### Context variables
Commands:
1. `set` (name, value)
    - sets context variable
2. `unset` (name)
    - unsets context variable

##### Event handlers
Commands:
1. `register` (event, handler)
    - registers handler for event
    - handler is a piece of JS code to be evaluated with access to:
        + immutable state object
        + context variables
        + commands in form of JS functions with same name and arguments as commands

2. `unregister` (event)
    - unregisters handler for event

Special case of configuration-only event handling is event `on_start` which is called when device starts.
